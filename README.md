- 👋 Hi, I’m @MicaelaManera
- 👀 I'm interested in travel around the world meeting people from different countries with different culture; I like read romantic and dramatic novels; I enjoy spend time with my friends; I love be in contact with nature, so anytime that I can I go to the mountain. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and everithing that I can. I'm recently started to study IT, so everything is new and interesting. Sometimes I think that we never ask for what is behind a web site or a virtual game, and discover all this is fascinating. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project that make me improve my skills, my knowledge, meet new people and learn from and with them. If I have the opportunity, then I would like to start working for someone who like my profile and the way that I work. 
- 📫 You can reach me via email: micmanera0311@gmail.com or phone number: +54 9 3533404977.
